# Holonomic-Path-Following-Simulator

Uses Matplotlib to simulate the pure pursuit algorithm for holonomic drives. The algorithm continuously chases a point that is a look ahead distance away until the endpoint is reached. 
The paths are generated using cubic bezier curves, check main.py for usage.
